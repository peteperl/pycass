Python toolkit for Cassandra Time-Series Data  
With simple changes to the schema, this can be adapted to a variety of time-series date. Feel free to ping me for guidance after you go through the tutorial below.  

## Cassandra Advanced Time Series Tutorial

I have prepared a tutorial on using Cassandra for advanced time series data due to multiple requests.  
The blogs go from basic to advanced. I have also included some Cassandra CQL basics that will help with schema design and key indexing.  

#### Take these in order:

http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/advanced-time-series-with-cassandra   
(The last one is most relevant for large scale time-series logging from varying sources, but build up to it.)  

#### Cassandra CQL: (some additional needed knowledge)
